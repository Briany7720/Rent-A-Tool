# **Rent-A-Tool**

Rent-A-Tool is an online platform dedicated to the people of Jamaica, a country which lacks a widely accessible platform for renting tools. 
The Rent-A-Tool platform is a web-based system designed to connect tool owners with renters. The architecture adopts a framework which is 
modular and service-oriented to guarantee scalability, maintainability, efficiency and security.  Many tool owners currently struggle to keep 
track of tool availability, rental transactions, and securely handle payments, which can result in misunderstandings and possible losses. A 
web-based system that streamlines rental transactions, automates inventory management, and guarantees proper record-keeping is the proposed 
solution. Whether it be tool owners who want to make a profit from renting out their tools or renters who want to make a one-time use of tool 
without having to purchase it at full cost, all users will benefit from this brand new and innovative platform.
